/*
 * 1. Whate is Polymorphism?
 * 
 * 		An object showing the differrent behaviour at the different stages of its life cycle called Polymrophism.
 * 
 * 		* Same action in multiple ways.

		* We can acheive Polymorphism in 2 ways 1. Method Overloading, 2. Method Overriding.
 
		* WE have 2 types of Poly morphism available in java.
 * 
 * 
 * a. Compile time Polymorphism. ---> Method Overloading.
 * 	  		An object showing the differrent behaviour at the different stages of its life cycle,-
 *    at the compile time based on the arguments passed.
 *    
 * b. Run time polymorphism.
 * 			An object showing the differrent behaviour at the different stages of its life cycle,-
 *    at the run time based on the object created.
