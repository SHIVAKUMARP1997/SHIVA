 *
 *  The stack contains all the methods of Vector class and also provides its methods like Boolean push(), boolean peak(), boolean push(object o), which define its properties. 
 *
 *  Stack s =new Stack<String>() 
 *
 *  Some of its methods are:------------ 
 *
 *  Pop() -  removes the last object.

 *  Peak()-looks at the last object without removing it from the stack. 
 *
 *  push() - it works exactly same as the addElement.
